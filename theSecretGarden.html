            <p id="review-two">Tucked away behind ivy-covered gates, The Secret Garden lives up to its name, offering diners a magical escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. With fairy lights draped over the trees and tables nestled between blooming flowers, the atmosphere is dreamy and romantic—a perfect spot for date nights and special occasions. The service was attentive yet unobtrusive, adding to the calm ambiance.

                                Wild Mushroom and Truffle Soup – ★★★★★
                                This velvety soup was a highlight of the meal. The earthy flavors of wild mushrooms paired beautifully with the rich truffle, and a dash of cream gave it a perfect smoothness. Served in a rustic bowl, it was warm, aromatic, and absolutely delicious—a must-try.

                                Rosemary and Thyme Roast Chicken – ★★★★☆
                                The chicken was perfectly roasted, with crispy skin and tender meat, seasoned with rosemary, thyme, and a hint of lemon. It was served with garlic-roasted vegetables and a side of golden mashed potatoes. While the flavor was delightful, the portion size could have been a bit more generous.

                               Pan-Seared Salmon with Dill Sauce – ★★★★★
                               This dish was beautifully plated, with a perfectly seared salmon fillet resting on a bed of sautéed asparagus and wild rice. The dill sauce was creamy, with just enough zest to complement the fish without overpowering it. Fresh and flavorful, this dish was a standout.

                               Passionfruit Pavlova – ★★★★☆
                               For dessert, we ordered the pavlova, a light, crisp meringue topped with passionfruit and whipped cream. The tangy passionfruit was a lovely contrast to the sweetness of the meringue. While the flavors were delightful, the meringue was slightly chewy rather than crisp in the center.

                               Final Thoughts: The Secret Garden is a beautiful escape into a world of delicate flavors and picturesque surroundings. Ideal for a special evening, it’s a charming spot where food, ambiance, and a touch of whimsy come together beautifully.
